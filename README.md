# Middle-Out-Compression

Middleout Compression is a novel lossless entropy encoder. This algorithm is still undergoing testing.

# Stacking Compression Algorithms

Middleout Compression can work in either binary state (not yet implemented) or byte state. There is more work to be done to test where middleout works best.

Middleout works best with run length encoding which is yet to be implemented.
