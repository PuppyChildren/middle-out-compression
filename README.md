# Middle-Out-Compression

Middleout Compression is a novel lossless entropy encoder. This algorithm has consistently outperformed huffman coding and arithmetic coding. It performs similar to bz2 to and gzip with no other compression formats or entropy reduction algorithms stacked with it

# Stacking Compression Algorithms

Middleout Compression can work in either binary state of byte state. There is more work to be done to test where middleout works best.
