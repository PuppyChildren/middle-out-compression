# Middle-Out-Compression

Middleout Compression is a novel lossless entropy encoder.

This algorithm uses top-down and left-right compression simultaneously.

# Stacking Compression Algorithms

Middleout is stacked upon lz4 to give higher compression ratios.

# Usage

*__For compress.py example usage:__*

*python compress.py* [*-o* | File path to file that needs to be compressed] [*-c* | Path to folder for compressed file/default=working directory]

*__For decompress.py example usage:__*

*python decompress.py* [*-c* | File path to the compressed .bin file] [*-p* | Path to folder for decompressed file/default=working directory]
